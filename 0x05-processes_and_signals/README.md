In Linux, every running program or command is called a process. Each process is assigned a unique number by the operating system, known as its Process ID (PID). The PID is crucial for managing processes â€“ for example, if you need to stop a misbehaving program, you often use its PID. Understanding PIDs is a fundamental concept in system administration and scripting.
The objective of this task is to ensure you know how to retrieve and display the Process ID of the script itself as it runs. This demonstrates your ability to access dynamic information about the current shell environment.

Task: Write a Bash script that displays its own Process ID (PID). The script should output only the PID number, followed by a new line.

Here is an example illustrating how your script should behave when executed:
